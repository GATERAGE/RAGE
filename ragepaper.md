## Chapter 1: Introduction

### Background
The evolution of artificial intelligence from static models to dynamic, adaptive systems marks a pivotal shift in technology's ability to interact with and understand the world. Traditional AI systems, reliant on static datasets, often fail to incorporate new information dynamically and struggle to provide contextually relevant responses in real-time scenarios.
